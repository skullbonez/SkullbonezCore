@rem Purpose:
@rem   Documents and runs the style_harness.bat developer/validation helper script.
@rem
@rem Summary:
@rem   Tools are command-line guardrails around builds, validation, screenshots,
@rem   diagnostics, and artifact handling. They make the safe path repeatable and
@rem   keep output bounded for humans and agents.
@rem
@rem Glossary:
@rem   Validation gate: Repository script that proves a class of changes before
@rem   commit or PR.
@rem
@rem Invariants:
@rem   - Tool output should be bounded and readable because agents and humans use
@rem   it for decisions.
